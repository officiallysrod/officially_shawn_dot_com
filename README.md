# Welcome!
This is the repo for officiallyshawn.com, my little corner of the internet.

The site makes use of Middleman, an awesome tool for building static sites. If you like to party with Ruby/Rails/Sinatra/Padrino, then Middleman will feel very familiar. With no serious backend concerns to deal with here (my \"database\" is a YAML file!), I treat Officiallyshawn.com as a playground for diving deeper into front-end technologies I am interested in exploring. In particular, the site makes use of Thoughbot's great open-source SASS libraries (Bourbon, Bitters, Neat, and Refills), and a lot of Flexbox.

You can check out the site [here](http://officiallyshawn.com).
