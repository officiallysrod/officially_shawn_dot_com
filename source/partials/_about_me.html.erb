    <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a builder. Problem solver. Traveler. Photographer. Skier. Native Texan, former Chicagoan, and happy to call myself a Californian. I'm a lover of learning, design, innovation, novel solutions, and keeping it simple. <span>Roller up of sleeves. Writer of code.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      My past experience in arts administration has shown me that idealism and pragmatism can exist together, often with great success. I bring this mindset to my work as a developer and I am driven by the desire to <span>build things that bring joy and utility to peoples' lives.</span>
