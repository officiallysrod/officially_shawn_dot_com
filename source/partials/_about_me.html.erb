      <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
      <p class="about-me-intro">
        I'm a builder. Problem solver. Traveler. Photographer. Skier. Native Texan, former Chicagoan, and happy to call myself a Californian. I'm a lover of learning, design, innovation, novel solutions, and keeping it simple. <span>Roller up of sleeves. Writer of code.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        My arts background has taught me that idealism and pragmatism can exist together, often with great success. I bring this mindset to my work as a developer and I am driven by the desire to <span>build things that bring joy and utility to peoples' lives.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past two years, I have built a solid foundation in programming and web development best practices, with an emphasis on writing clean, maintainable code. My focus now is on diving deeper into several areas of interest, including: the principles of object-oriented design, leveraging proven design patterns, and software architecture best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, though, the thing that drives me is simple: <span>shipping great code!</span>

        “[How] to think about code, how to balance performance and clarity and scalability and elegance and make smart decisions, how to diagnose problems from limited information, how to form a hypothesis and rigorously test it—these talents elevate a proficient developer to a great one…Shawn has these skills. Combine that with his other strengths and I can't recommend him highly enough.”
