      <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a builder. Problem solver. Traveler. Photographer. Skier. Native Texan, former Chicagoan, and happy to call myself a Californian. I'm a lover of learning, design, innovation, novel solutions, and keeping it simple. <span>Roller up of sleeves. Writer of code.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        My past experience working in the arts has shown me that idealism and pragmatism can exist together, often with great success. I bring this mindset to my work as a developer and I am driven by the desire to <span>build things that bring joy and utility to peoples' lives.</span>
      </p>
      <h3>What I'm About</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past two years, I have worked hard to build a solid foundation in programming and web development best practices, with an emphasis on writing clean, maintainable code. My focus now is on diving deeper into several areas of personal and professional interest, including: the principles of object-oriented design, proven design patterns, data modeling, and software architecture best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the day, though, the thing that drives me is simple: <span>shipping great code!</span>
