- name: Fetch
  description: "Fetch, a social network for dogs (and the owners who love them), was conceived at General Assembly during the Web Development Immersive program. Fetch gives dogs (and their owners) the opportunity to connect for doggy play dates.
  Fetch was built with AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL. Fetch takes advantages of Rails 4's ActionController::Live in combination with Puma web server and Redis to stream one-to-one messages to users in realtime."

- name: WDiPSUM
  description: "WDiPSUM is a simple little ipsum generator filled with inside jokes from the Web Development Immersive class I taught at General Assembly. Teaching a web developer bootcamp involves building LOTS of example CRUD applications to teach students the fundamentals of Rails and web development. Needless to say, when you're building a blog or a Reddit clone for the 500th time, an ipsum generator comes in handy!"
