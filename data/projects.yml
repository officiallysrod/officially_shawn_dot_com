  description: "Officiallyshawn.com is my little corner of the internet. The site makes use of Middleman, an awesome tool for building static sites. If you like to party with Ruby/Rails/Sinatra/Padrino, then Middleman will feel very familiar.
  <br><br>
  With no serious backend concerns to deal with here (my \"database\" is a YAML file!), I treat Officiallyshawn.com as a playground for diving deeper into front-end technologies I am interested in exploring. In particular, the site makes use of Thoughbot's great open-source SASS libraries (Bourbon, Bitters, Neat, and Refills), and a lot of Flexbox. The code is in a public repo on Github, so feel free to have a look."

- name: betterNOTE
  description: "An OS X note-taking app for the Markdown-writing, Vim-loving folks out there!  Still in development. Not ready for prime time.
  Okay, so the name is definitely a little cheeky. But let's set that aside and talk about the motivation for building this app. I'm an active Evernote user and generally I find it to be mostly, usually, kinda pretty alright. Sort of.
  <br><br>
  betterNOTE solves the two biggest pain points I experience with Evernote by adding support for Vim keybindings and Markdown support.
  As I said, this project is still in development, but you can head over to Github to check out the repo and follow its progress."

- name: OpinioNation
  description: "OpinioNation was my final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. It is an online community that connects people who have questions with people who have answers. The mantra of OpinioNation is: \"Ask a question. Give an answer. Get involved.\" The site favors visual, bite-sized, fun, engagement.
  <br><br>
  The app was built with AngularJS, Ruby on Rails (serving primarily as the API layer), and PostgreSQL."

- name: Fetch
  description: "Fetch, a social network for dogs (and the owners who love them), was conceived at General Assembly during the Web Development Immersive program. Fetch gives dogs (and their owners) the opportunity to connect for doggy play dates.
  <br><br>
  Fetch was built with AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, and PostgreSQL. Fetch takes advantages of Rails 4's ActionController::Live in combination with Puma web server and Redis to stream one-to-one messages to users in realtime."

- name: WDiPSUM
  description: "WDiPSUM is a simple little ipsum generator filled with inside jokes from the Web Development Immersive class I taught at General Assembly. Teaching a web developer bootcamp involves building LOTS of example CRUD applications to teach students the fundamentals of Rails and web development.
  <br><br>
  Needless to say, when you're building a blog or a Reddit clone for the 500th time, an ipsum generator comes in handy!"
